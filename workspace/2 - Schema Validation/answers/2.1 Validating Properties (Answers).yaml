    # Exercise: Validating Properties
    
    This document contains a single object schema definition.
    
    Adjust the schema so that the first object instance is valid,
    and the second one is not.
    
    ## Valid Instance
    ```
    {
      "accountID" : "ASDF1234",
      "customerID" : "987-89-2345",
      "branch" : "CLARKSVILLE_987"
      "dateOpened" : "2017-04-10",
      "balance" : "10782.53",
      "isJointAccount" : false
    }
    ```
    
    ## Invalid Instance      
    ```
    {
      "accountID" : "ASDF1234",
      "customerID" : "987-89-2345",
      "lastStatement" : "2019-03-16"
      "branch" : "CLARKSVILLE_987"
      "dateOpened" : "2017-04-10",
      "balance" : "10782.53",
      "isJointAccount" : false,
